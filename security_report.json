(Server-Side)\n===========================================================\n\n**Security Note:** Do not hardcode or expose your application's secrets, including API keys. Instead, use environment variables or secure storage solutions.\n\n### Problem Statement\n-------------------\n\nYou are tasked with implementing a server-side component that securely retrieves an API key from a database or configuration file and uses it to authenticate requests.\n\n### Solution Overview\n--------------------\n\nTo address this challenge, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.  **Store sensitive data in environment variables**: We'll store our API key as an environment variable instead of hardcoding it.\n2.  **Use a secure method to retrieve the API key**: Depending on your project requirements, you may need to read the value from a configuration file, database, or"
